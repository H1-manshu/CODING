/*  1) #include <iostream>
# (Hashtag) ke baad agar kuch bhi likha hai C++ Program mein toh usko ham bolte hai "Directive"
And these directibves are processed by a preprocessor, preprocessor kuch nahi hota hai ye ek program hota hai jo ki Compiler Run karta hai, idhar jo #include hai ye hamare preprocessor ko bata raha hai ki iske aage jo bhi kuch likha hua hai usko hame apne code mein include karna hai

____  iostream is a header file , we have a lot of header files in C++ and "iostream is one of them" 
iostream has input/output , output = cout ...

   2) using namespace std;
If we don't use "using namespace std;" in our code then we will have to write "cout" statement in a different way
that is "std::cout"
 
   3) int main(){
   }   
There is a particular method of defining a function in C++ that is; 
First of all we write "return type"

Secondly we write "function name" as we can call a function in different times so its given a specific name"

Thirdly we write "()" parentheses to send any parameters or inputs to our function

Fourthly we write "{ }" (Curly brackets) we write the things which we want to execute inside these curly brackets
